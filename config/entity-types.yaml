# Entity Types Configuration for LightRAG Knowledge Graph Construction
#
# This configuration file defines the entity types that LightRAG will use during
# entity extraction and graph construction. Entity types guide the LLM to extract
# relevant entities based on your knowledge domain.
#
# Structure:
#   entity_types:
#     - type_name: <lowercase_no_spaces>
#       description: "<human-readable description>"
#       examples:
#         - "<example 1>"
#         - "<example 2>"
#
# Customization:
# - Add domain-specific entity types using POST /api/v1/config/entity-types
# - Or edit this file directly and restart the service
# - See docs/entity-configuration.md for domain-specific examples
