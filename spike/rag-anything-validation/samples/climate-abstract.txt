Climate Change Science: A Research Abstract

The accelerating impact of anthropogenic climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Comprehensive analysis of global temperature records from 1880 to 2023 demonstrates an unequivocal warming trend, with the past decade recording the highest average temperatures in recorded history.

Key Findings:
- Global mean surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1째C since pre-industrial times
- Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have risen from 280 ppm in 1850 to 420 ppm in 2023
- Arctic sea ice extent has declined by approximately 13% per decade since 1979
- Global sea levels have risen by 21-24 cm since 1880, with acceleration in recent decades

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report confirms that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land with high confidence. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes are the primary drivers of observed warming.

Climate models project continued warming under all emission scenarios, with temperature increases ranging from 1.5째C to 4.5째C by 2100 depending on mitigation efforts. Impacts include more frequent extreme weather events, ecosystem disruption, sea level rise, and threats to food and water security.

Urgent action is required to limit warming to 1.5째C above pre-industrial levels, necessitating rapid decarbonization of energy systems, enhanced carbon sequestration, and adaptation strategies to address unavoidable impacts.
