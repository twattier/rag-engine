  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Rate limiting applied. Proper input validation for batch size, metadata formats. No security vulnerabilities detected.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Sequential processing for memory efficiency. Performance tests validate >10 docs/min KPI. Async background processing prevents API blocking.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with partial failure support. Individual document failures don"t block batch. Structured logging for observability.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns (MetadataMapper, BatchService, endpoints). TYPE_CHECKING for circular import resolution. Well-documented code with docstrings.'
