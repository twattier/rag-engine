notes: |
  Exceptional implementation quality. The code demonstrates mature software engineering practices:
  - Clean architecture with separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
  - Performance optimization through intelligent batching
  - Excellent observability through structured logging
  - Strong type safety preventing runtime errors

  This story represents a production-ready feature that integrates seamlessly with Story 3.2's
  entity extraction foundation. The relationship mapping and graph construction capabilities
  enable powerful knowledge graph traversal for the RAG engine.

  Recommend: Mark as "Done" and proceed with Epic 3 integration testing.
