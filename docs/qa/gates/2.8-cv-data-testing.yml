# Review summary
review_summary: |
  Story 2.8 delivers a comprehensive end-to-end testing infrastructure with excellent code quality.
  All 7 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with outstanding documentation (1000+ lines).

  **Strengths:**
  - Excellent code quality (type hints, docstrings, error handling throughout)
  - Comprehensive E2E tests with real CV data from HuggingFace
  - Outstanding documentation (testing-guide.md: 718 lines, sample-data.md: 293 lines)
  - Performance metrics exceed all targets (throughput 15-25 docs/min vs 10 target)
  - Persistent-by-default philosophy well-implemented with clean mode for CI/CD
  - All NFRs met (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  - Zero refactoring needed - production-ready code

  **Concerns (Non-Blocking):**
  - Medium: External dataset dependency could cause test flakiness (mitigate with fallback fixtures)
  - Low: Shell scripts lack unit tests (acceptable for utility code)
  - Low: Coverage metrics not measured (recommend adding to CI/CD)

  **Requirements Traceability:**
  All 7 ACs mapped to implementation with test coverage:
  - AC1: Sample data download (script + docs)
  - AC2: E2E test suite (3 comprehensive tests)
  - AC3: CV entity types (10 types configured + validated)
  - AC4: Health validation (bash script with 8 tests)
  - AC5: Cleanup script (granular control with safety)
  - AC6: Documentation (1000+ lines comprehensive guides)
  - AC7: Performance baselines (metrics logged in tests)

  **Gate Decision Rationale:**
  PASS_WITH_CONCERNS reflects excellent implementation quality with minor future enhancements
  recommended. All concerns are non-blocking and story is ready for production use.
