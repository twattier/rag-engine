# Quality Gate Decision - Story 2.7: Schema Migration
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.7"
story_title: "Implement Metadata Schema Migration and Reindexing"
gate: PASS_WITH_CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation meeting all acceptance criteria with minor technical debt items identified. Concerns relate to future scalability enhancements (schema versioning, job persistence) rather than blocking issues."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
