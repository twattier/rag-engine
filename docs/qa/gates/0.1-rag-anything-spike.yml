# Quality Gate: Story 0.1 - RAG-Anything Technical Validation Spike

schema: 1
story: "0.1"
story_title: "RAG-Anything Technical Validation Spike"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent spike infrastructure and preparation work completed. All 6 sample documents generated, comprehensive test framework created (887 LOC), and thorough API research documented. However, core validation testing remains incomplete - RAG-Anything not yet tested due to installation delays. Spike deliverables partially met (3/7 ACs validated)."

top_issues:
  - id: "SPIKE-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Core validation testing not executed - RAG-Anything parsing untested"
    suggested_action: "Complete RAG-Anything installation and run test_all_formats.py to validate format support (AC1, AC2)"
  - id: "SPIKE-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing scanned PDF sample - only placeholder note exists"
    suggested_action: "Create or obtain scanned PDF for OCR validation testing"
  - id: "SPIKE-003"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Docker isolation approach abandoned - using local venv instead"
    suggested_action: "Document Docker as production approach; venv acceptable for spike validation"
  - id: "SPIKE-004"
    severity: low
    finding: "Performance benchmarking script not created (AC3)"
    suggested_action: "Create benchmark_parsing.py or document why not needed for preliminary recommendation"

risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 1, medium: 2, low: 1 }
  highest: high
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Execute format validation tests before finalizing spike report"
    monitor:
      - "Time box compliance (2-day limit) - currently at end of Day 1"
      - "Recommendation confidence level without hands-on testing"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Spike code has no security concerns. Malformed document testing plan includes Docker isolation (not yet executed)."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "AC3 performance benchmarking not completed. No actual parsing time measurements available."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "AC4 error handling validation not completed. Unknown how RAG-Anything behaves with malformed documents."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-structured code with clear separation of concerns. Excellent documentation and comments. Domain-coherent samples enable future reuse."

notes: |
  This is a SPIKE story focused on research and validation, not production code.
  Gate assessment criteria adapted accordingly:

  - Infrastructure Quality: EXCELLENT ✓
    * Complete test framework (887 LOC)
    * All 6 sample documents generated
    * Comprehensive API research
    * Well-documented approach

  - Validation Completeness: INCOMPLETE ⚠️
    * ACs 1-4 not validated (no test execution)
    * No actual parsing results
    * No performance data
    * No error handling observations

  - Spike Report: IN PROGRESS ⚠️
    * Strong preliminary findings
    * Go/no-go recommendation drafted
    * Missing: actual test results

  CONCERNS gate reflects excellent preparation offset by incomplete validation.
  Spike can proceed to completion with test execution or document why validation
  was blocked and provide recommendation based on research only.

  Recommended Path Forward:
  1. Complete RAG-Anything installation OR
  2. Pivot: Test simpler fallback parsers (python-docx, pypdf) to unblock decision OR
  3. Close spike with research-only recommendation (lower confidence)
