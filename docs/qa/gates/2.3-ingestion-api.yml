# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Mock authentication adequate for Epic 2 MVP. Real implementation planned for Epic 4. Parameterized queries prevent injection. Rate limiting implemented. File validation present."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async I/O throughout. Neo4j connection pooling (max 50). Proper indexing on Document.id, metadata, status. Efficient rate limiting algorithm. 300s timeout for large files."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with standardized responses. Neo4j retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff). Graceful degradation for parsing failures. Health checks configured."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code structure. Proper separation of concerns (routers → services → repository). Shared utilities used correctly. Type hints with Pydantic V2. Structured logging throughout."

    gate: PASS
    note: "Initial QA review - Excellent implementation quality. All ACs met. Security concerns documented for future epics. Ready for Done status."

# Additional context
notes: |
  Story 2.3 demonstrates exceptional implementation quality with proper architecture,
  comprehensive testing, and excellent use of shared services. The implementation
  correctly avoids hardcoded ports and uses environment-based configuration throughout.

  Key Strengths:
  - All 9 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
  - 10 comprehensive integration tests covering all error scenarios
  - Proper use of shared services (Neo4j client, logging, metadata)
  - No hardcoded network ports (all configurable via .env)
  - Clean separation of concerns with proper dependency injection
  - Parameterized Cypher queries prevent SQL injection
  - Comprehensive error handling with standardized responses

  Security Considerations:
  The mock API key validation is explicitly scoped for Epic 2 testing per the story
  requirements. Real authentication is planned for Epic 4 Story 4.2. This is an
  acceptable trade-off for MVP development and properly documented.

  Recommendation: APPROVE for Done status. Document technical debt items in Epic 4
  and Epic 5 backlogs as noted in recommendations section.
