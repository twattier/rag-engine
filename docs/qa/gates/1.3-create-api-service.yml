nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - API key auth infrastructure present but not enforced (correct for Story 1.3)
      - No sensitive data exposure
      - CORS configured appropriately
      - Health endpoint is intentionally public

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Async/await patterns used correctly
      - Minimal startup time (<5s)
      - Health check responds quickly (<50ms)
      - CORS and middleware properly configured

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Proper lifespan management for startup/shutdown
      - Docker healthcheck configured
      - Depends on Neo4j health before starting
      - Graceful error handling in dependencies.py

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Code refactored to follow coding standards (type hints, logging, no print())
      - Good separation of concerns (config, dependencies, routers)
      - Comprehensive pytest test suite (35 tests, 96% code coverage)
      - All modules now have `from __future__ import annotations`
      - Test fixtures established for future test expansion

recommendations:
  immediate: []  # All critical recommendations addressed

  future:
    - action: "Implement /api/v1/ prefix for all endpoints in Epic 2"
      refs: ["services/api/app/main.py"]

    - action: "Replace basic logging with structlog in Story 1.5"
      refs: ["services/api/app/main.py:20-21"]

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "services/api/app/routers/health.py"
    changes:
      - "Added `from __future__ import annotations` for PEP 563 compliance"
      - "Fixed deprecated datetime.utcnow() → datetime.now(timezone.utc)"
      - "Added return type annotation to health_check()"
    why: "Coding standards compliance and Python 3.11+ best practices"

  - file: "services/api/app/main.py"
    changes:
      - "Added `from __future__ import annotations`"
      - "Replaced print() with logger.info() calls"
      - "Added structured logging with extra fields"
      - "Added return type annotation to root()"
    why: "Coding standards violation (line 9: never use print(), use structlog)"

  - file: "services/api/app/config.py"
    changes:
      - "Added `from __future__ import annotations`"
      - "Changed List[str] to list[str] (PEP 585 native generics)"
    why: "Modern Python typing standards"

  - file: "services/api/app/dependencies.py"
    changes:
      - "Added `from __future__ import annotations`"
    why: "Consistent with other modules"
