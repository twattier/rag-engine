# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Complete directory structure matching architecture specifications"
    - "Comprehensive Docker Compose with health checks and dependency management"
    - "Extensive .env.example with 252 lines of inline documentation"
    - "Professional README with badges, architecture diagram, and clear quick-start"
    - "Security-focused .gitignore patterns"
    - "Consistent Dockerfile patterns across all services"
    - "COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME prefix for volume/network namespace isolation"
    - "All port mappings configurable via environment variables"

  minor_observations:
    - "scripts/validate-deployment.sh referenced in README but not yet created (non-blocking)"
    - "CONTRIBUTING.md referenced in README but not yet created (non-blocking)"
    - "No automated tests yet (expected for infrastructure-only story)"
    - "Docker Compose uses obsolete 'version' field (warning only, not blocking)"
