top_issues:
  - severity: medium
    category: consistency
    description: 'Three files (middleware.py, health.py, neo4j_client.py) were using structlog.get_logger() directly instead of centralized get_logger()'
    resolution: 'Fixed during QA review - all files now use shared.utils.logging.get_logger()'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No sensitive data logged; exc_info properly handles exceptions without exposing internals via API'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Logging middleware adds minimal overhead (~<5ms); structured fields avoid string interpolation performance penalties'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling; request_id enables distributed tracing; context properly cleared in finally block'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Well-documented code; centralized configuration; clear separation of concerns; excellent inline examples'

strengths:
  - 'Centralized logging configuration promoting DRY principle'
  - 'Dual format support (JSON/console) for different environments'
  - 'Request ID tracking for distributed tracing'
  - 'Context vars properly managed (cleared in finally blocks)'
  - 'Comprehensive documentation with practical examples'
  - 'Type hints throughout (from __future__ import annotations)'
  - 'Excellent test coverage with unit and integration tests'
  - 'Real-world manual testing evidence provided'
