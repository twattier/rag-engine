# Detailed review findings
strengths:
  - "Excellent Pydantic model design with comprehensive validation"
  - "Well-structured YAML configuration with clear comments and examples"
  - "Comprehensive test coverage (23 unit tests, 17 integration tests)"
  - "Proper error handling with specific error codes"
  - "Clear API documentation with examples"
  - "Cache invalidation properly implemented with lru_cache"
  - "Excellent user documentation with domain-specific examples"
  - "Proper dependency injection using FastAPI patterns"
  - "Type safety with strict type hints throughout"
  - "Clean separation of concerns (models, loader, API routes)"

observations:
  - "Dual cache invalidation required (entity_loader + dependencies) - documented but worth monitoring"
  - "LightRAG integration is a placeholder - appropriate for current epic scope"
  - "Authentication uses Bearer token format - consistent with REST API patterns"
  - "YAML file permissions handled gracefully with proper error codes"
