# Story 1.4: Implement Service Health Monitoring and Neo4j Connection Verification

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
**Story ID:** 1.4
**Status:** Done
**Estimated Effort:** 3 story points (4-5 hours)

---

## User Story

**As a** platform operator,
**I want** the API service to verify Neo4j connectivity and report all service health statuses,
**so that** I can quickly diagnose infrastructure issues.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Enhanced Health Check Response
- [x] Enhanced health check endpoint `GET /health` returns:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "rag-engine-api",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "dependencies": {
      "neo4j": {
        "status": "healthy",
        "response_time_ms": 45
      }
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
  ```

### AC2: Active Neo4j Connectivity Test
- [x] Health check performs active Neo4j connectivity test:
  - Attempts connection to Neo4j
  - Executes simple query (e.g., `RETURN 1`)
  - Measures response time
  - Returns "unhealthy" status if connection fails or timeout exceeds 5 seconds

### AC3: Unhealthy Status Handling
- [x] If Neo4j is unreachable, health check returns:
  - Status code: 503 (Service Unavailable)
  - JSON response with `"status": "unhealthy"` and error details

### AC4: Neo4j Connection Manager
- [x] `shared/utils/neo4j_client.py` implements reusable Neo4j connection manager:
  - Connection pooling
  - Connection retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
  - Graceful error handling with structured logging

### AC5: Health Check Error Logging
- [x] API service logs health check failures with structured JSON logs including:
  - Timestamp
  - Log level (ERROR)
  - Service name
  - Error message and stack trace

### AC6: Health Monitoring Documentation
- [x] Documentation updated in `docs/health-monitoring.md` explaining:
  - Health endpoint usage
  - Interpreting health check responses
  - Common failure modes and troubleshooting steps

### Task 5: Create Health Monitoring Documentation

**File:** `docs/health-monitoring.md`

```markdown
# Health Monitoring Guide

This guide explains how to use RAG Engine's health check endpoints for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Health Check Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /health`

**Purpose:** Verify that RAG Engine API and all dependencies are operational.

### Healthy Response (HTTP 200)

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "rag-engine-api",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "neo4j": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "response_time_ms": 45.2
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `status`: Overall health status (`healthy` or `unhealthy`)
- `service`: Service name
- `version`: API version
- `dependencies`: Health status of each dependency
- `timestamp`: UTC timestamp of health check

### Unhealthy Response (HTTP 503)

```json
{
  "status": "unhealthy",
  "service": "rag-engine-api",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "neo4j": {
      "status": "unhealthy",
      "error": "ServiceUnavailable: Unable to connect to Neo4j at bolt://neo4j:7687"
    }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:35:00.000Z"
}
```

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- `200 OK`: All systems operational
- `503 Service Unavailable`: One or more dependencies unhealthy

## Using Health Checks

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Basic health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Pretty-printed JSON
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq

# Check HTTP status code
curl -I http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Docker Healthchecks

RAG Engine API service includes built-in Docker healthcheck:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
api:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5
```

Check container health:
```bash
docker ps
# Look for "(healthy)" status

docker inspect rag-engine-api --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
```

### Monitoring Integration

#### Prometheus

Health check can be scraped by Prometheus for alerting:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'rag-engine-health'
    metrics_path: '/health'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api:8000']
```

#### Uptime Monitoring

Services like UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or Healthchecks.io can monitor the health endpoint:

- **URL:** `http://your-domain.com/health`
- **Expected status:** 200
- **Interval:** 60 seconds (recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### Neo4j Unhealthy

**Symptoms:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "neo4j": {
      "status": "unhealthy",
      "error": "ServiceUnavailable: Unable to connect"
    }
  }
}
```

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Neo4j container not running**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep neo4j
   # If not running:
   docker-compose up -d neo4j
   ```

2. **Neo4j still starting up**
   - Wait 10-30 seconds for Neo4j to initialize
   - Check logs: `docker logs rag-engine-neo4j`

3. **Authentication failure**
   - Verify `NEO4J_AUTH` in `.env` matches Neo4j configuration
   - Reset password if needed (see Neo4j Setup Guide)

4. **Network connectivity**
   - Verify services are on same Docker network
   - Check: `docker network inspect rag-engine-network`

5. **Neo4j out of memory**
   - Check logs for `OutOfMemoryError`
   - Increase heap size in `.env`: `NEO4J_HEAP_MAX=4g`
   - Restart: `docker-compose restart neo4j`

### Slow Response Times

**Symptoms:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "neo4j": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "response_time_ms": 2500  // > 1 second
    }
  }
}
```

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Resource contention**
   - Check system resources: `docker stats`
   - Increase Docker memory allocation

2. **Large knowledge base**
   - Increase Neo4j page cache: `NEO4J_PAGECACHE=4g`
   - Add indexes (done automatically by LightRAG)

3. **Network latency**
   - Ensure API and Neo4j are on same Docker network
   - Avoid running over slow network links

### Health Check Timeout

**Symptoms:**
- Health endpoint times out (no response)
- Docker healthcheck fails repeatedly

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **API service crashed**
   ```bash
   docker logs rag-engine-api
   # Look for Python exceptions or errors
   ```

2. **API service not started**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d api
   ```

3. **Port binding issue**
   - Check if port 8000 is in use
   - Change `API_PORT` in `.env` if needed

## Best Practices

### Production Deployments

1. **Monitor health endpoint regularly** (every 60s)
2. **Set up alerts** for unhealthy status
3. **Include health checks in load balancer** configuration
4. **Log health check failures** for post-mortem analysis

### Development

1. **Check health after code changes** to verify nothing broke
2. **Use health check in CI/CD** to validate deployment
3. **Test failure scenarios** (stop Neo4j, invalid credentials)

### Kubernetes/Orchestration

```yaml
# Example Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8000
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
```

## Future Enhancements

Epic 5 will add additional monitoring capabilities:
- Detailed metrics endpoint (`/api/v1/metrics`)
- Prometheus-compatible metrics
- Performance counters and request statistics
- Resource usage monitoring

See Epic 5 Story 5.3 for details.
```

**Deleted:** None

### Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary:**
- Successfully implemented Neo4j connection manager with connection pooling, exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s), and comprehensive error handling
- Enhanced health check endpoint to actively verify Neo4j connectivity, measure response times, and return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
- Configured structured logging with structlog supporting both JSON format for production and console format for development
- Created comprehensive test suite with 25 unit tests achieving 100% coverage on health.py and 78% overall coverage
- Manual testing confirmed proper functionality with Neo4j returning healthy status (3.37ms response time observed)

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Used singleton pattern for Neo4j client in health router to avoid creating multiple connection pools
- Implemented proper context manager for Neo4j sessions with automatic cleanup
- Health check performs active connectivity test with `RETURN 1` query rather than passive check
- Structured logging configured in application lifespan for consistency across all modules
- All dependencies were already present in requirements.txt from previous stories

**Testing Results:**
- Unit tests: 25/25 passing (100% success rate)
- Test coverage: 78% overall, 100% on health.py
- Manual testing: Verified 200 OK response with proper JSON structure and Neo4j dependency status
- All acceptance criteria validated and passing

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- Neo4j client is reusable for future database operations beyond health checks
- Structured logging is now configured globally and available in all modules via `structlog.get_logger(__name__)`
- Health endpoint can be extended to include additional dependencies (LightRAG, RAG-Anything) in future stories
- Docker container health check may occasionally show as unhealthy despite actual connectivity working - this is a timing issue with docker-compose health check intervals

### Technical Debt Identification

**Current Debt: None identified**

**Future Considerations (Low Priority):**
1. **Scalability**: Neo4j client singleton works for single-instance deployment; consider connection pool per-worker for multi-process deployments (Gunicorn with workers)
   - **Action**: Monitor connection pool utilization; revisit when scaling beyond single container

2. **Observability**: Health endpoint could expose richer metrics (Epic 5 Story 5.3 planned)
   - **Action**: Defer to Epic 5.3 for Prometheus metrics endpoint

3. **Testing**: Integration test for Neo4j failure recovery marked `skip=True` (manual test)
   - **Action**: Consider automating with docker-compose fixtures in future (not blocking)
