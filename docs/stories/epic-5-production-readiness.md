# Epic 5: Open-WebUI Integration & Production Readiness

**Status:** Draft
**Epic Goal:** Create Open-WebUI Function Pipeline for seamless integration, implement production-grade error handling, logging, and deployment documentation for end-to-end MVP validation. Delivers primary user integration and production deployment readiness.

## Stories in this Epic

### Story 5.1: Develop Open-WebUI Function Pipeline
**As a** Open-WebUI user,
**I want** to deploy RAG Engine as a function pipeline in Open-WebUI,
**so that** I can query my knowledge base through Open-WebUI's chat interface.

[Details in Story File: 5.1.openwebui-pipeline.md]

---

### Story 5.2: Implement Production-Grade Error Handling and Retry Logic
**As a** platform operator,
**I want** automatic retry logic and graceful error recovery,
**so that** transient failures don't break user workflows.

[Details in Story File: 5.2.error-handling-retry.md]

---

### Story 5.3: Implement Monitoring Endpoints and Operational Metrics
**As a** platform operator,
**I want** monitoring endpoints exposing operational metrics,
**so that** I can track system health and performance.

[Details in Story File: 5.3.monitoring-metrics.md]

---

### Story 5.4: Create Production Deployment Documentation
**As a** production operator,
**I want** comprehensive deployment documentation for production environments,
**so that** I can deploy RAG Engine securely and reliably.

[Details in Story File: 5.4.production-docs.md]

---

### Story 5.5: Conduct End-to-End MVP Validation and Performance Testing
**As a** product manager,
**I want** validation that all MVP success criteria are met,
**so that** I can confidently launch RAG Engine to users.

[Details in Story File: 5.5.mvp-validation.md]

---

### Story 5.6: Create User Onboarding Documentation and Quick Start Guide
**As a** new RAG Engine user,
**I want** a comprehensive quick start guide,
**so that** I can successfully deploy and use RAG Engine without prior knowledge.

[Details in Story File: 5.6.quick-start-guide.md]

## Technical Notes

### Key Technologies
- Open-WebUI Function Pipeline Python API
- Pydantic for function configuration validation
- structlog for error tracking
- prometheus-client for metrics export
- pytest for E2E validation
- BEIR benchmark dataset (SciFact) for retrieval quality testing

### Open-WebUI Function Pipeline
- File: `integrations/open-webui/rag_engine_pipeline.py`
- Implements Open-WebUI Function interface
- Configuration: RAG Engine API endpoint, API key, retrieval mode, reranking toggle
- Features: Document ingestion via file upload, knowledge base query, metadata filtering
- Response format: Cited sources with document names, relevance scores, metadata tags

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s), max 3 attempts
- **Circuit Breaker**: After 5 consecutive LLM failures, stop calling for 60 seconds
- **Graceful Degradation**: If reranking fails, return non-reranked results with warning
- **Structured Error Logging**: error type, retry attempts, service name, request context

### Monitoring Metrics
- **Request Metrics**: Total requests, requests by endpoint, response times, error rates
- **Knowledge Base Metrics**: Document count, entity count, relationship count, chunk count
- **Performance Metrics**: Query latency (P50, P95, P99), retrieval latency, reranking latency
- **System Metrics**: Memory usage, CPU usage, Neo4j database size, connection pool stats

### Production Deployment Checklist
1. ✅ Hardware requirements met (16GB RAM, 8 CPU cores, 100GB storage)
2. ✅ Security hardening: API key rotation, TLS with reverse proxy, network isolation
3. ✅ Backup strategy: Neo4j automated backups, disaster recovery procedures
4. ✅ Monitoring: Prometheus integration, log aggregation (optional ELK stack)
5. ✅ Resource limits: Docker Compose memory/CPU limits configured
6. ✅ Health checks: All services have health check endpoints with restart policies
7. ✅ Documentation: Production deployment guide, troubleshooting, runbooks

### MVP Success Criteria Validation
1. ✅ Single-command deployment: `docker-compose up` completes in <5 minutes
2. ✅ End-to-end workflow: Ingest 100+ documents → query → visualize in <30 minutes
3. ✅ Performance: P95 query latency <2s on 1000-document knowledge base
4. ✅ Metadata filtering: >40% latency reduction on 20% subset
5. ✅ Retrieval quality: MRR > 0.80 on BEIR SciFact dataset (vs. 0.65-0.70 baseline)
6. ✅ Open-WebUI integration: Functional end-to-end (upload → query → cited results)
7. ✅ Documentation: All docs complete, tested, and accessible

## Epic Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Open-WebUI API changes | Low | High | Pin Open-WebUI function API version, test against specific version |
| Performance targets not met | Medium | High | Early benchmarking, metadata filtering optimization, Neo4j tuning |
| BEIR benchmark unavailable | Low | Medium | Alternative datasets (MS MARCO, Natural Questions), manual testing |
| Production docs incomplete | Medium | Medium | Review checklist, security expert review, user testing |
| MVP validation fails | Low | Critical | Incremental testing throughout Epics 1-4, address issues early |
