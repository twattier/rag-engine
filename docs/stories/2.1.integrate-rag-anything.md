# Story 2.1: Integrate RAG-Anything Library and Create Document Parsing Service

**Epic:** Epic 2 - Multi-Format Document Ingestion Pipeline
**Story ID:** 2.1
**Status:** Done
**Estimated Effort:** 5 story points (6-8 hours)

---

## User Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a containerized RAG-Anything parsing service that accepts documents and extracts structured content,
**so that** I can process multiple document formats consistently.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `services/rag-anything-integration/` contains RAG-Anything integration service with FastAPI endpoints
2. Service exposes endpoint `POST /parse` accepting document upload with multipart/form-data
3. **Supported formats (6 document types):**
   - PDF (.pdf) - text-based and image-based/scanned
   - Plain text (.txt)
   - Markdown (.md)
   - Microsoft Word (.docx)
   - Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx)
   - CSV (.csv)
4. Parse endpoint returns structured JSON with extracted content:
   - Text blocks with structure preservation
   - Images (as base64 or references) from PDF, Word, PowerPoint
   - Tables from PDF, Word, PowerPoint, CSV
   - Equations from PDF
   - Slide layouts from PowerPoint
5. Service runs in Docker container with RAG-Anything dependencies installed
6. `docker-compose.yml` includes `rag-anything-integration` service configuration
7. Integration tests verify parsing of sample documents for each supported format
8. Error handling for unsupported formats returns 400 with clear error message
9. **GPU Acceleration (Optional):** Documentation includes GPU passthrough setup instructions for MinerU performance optimization (optional enhancement, not required for MVP)
10. **Fallback Parsers:** For formats that fail Story 0.1 spike validation, implement fallback parsers (pypdf, python-docx, python-pptx, pandas) as documented in spike report

### API Endpoint Specification
[Source: architecture/components.md, architecture/core-workflows.md]

**Endpoint:** `POST /parse`

**Request Format:**
```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- file: <uploaded file>
```

**Response Format (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "content_list": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Sample content",
      "page_idx": 0,
      "structure": "paragraph"
    },
    {
      "type": "image",
      "image_ref": "base64_or_path",
      "caption": "Auto-generated caption",
      "page_idx": 1
    },
    {
      "type": "table",
      "rows": [[...], [...]],
      "page_idx": 2
    },
    {
      "type": "equation",
      "latex": "E = mc^2",
      "page_idx": 3
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "filename": "document.pdf",
    "format": "pdf",
    "pages": 10,
    "parse_method": "mineru"
  }
}
```

**Error Response (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT",
    "message": "File format .xyz is not supported. Supported formats: pdf, txt, md, docx, pptx, csv"
  }
}
```

**Error Response (500 Internal Server Error):**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "PARSING_FAILED",
    "message": "Failed to parse document: <error details>"
  }
}
```

### Document Ingestion Workflow
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]

The RAG-Anything service fits into the overall ingestion workflow:

```
User → FastAPI API → RAG-Anything Service → LightRAG Service → Neo4j
```

**RAG-Anything Service Tasks:**
1. Receive document file from API service
2. Parse document via MinerU (extract text, images, tables)
3. Generate image captions (if images present) - Epic 3 integration
4. Build content_list (text, images, tables, equations)
5. Return content_list to API service

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- **Type Safety:** Use Pydantic V2 for all models; strict type hints (`from __future__ import annotations`)
- **Error Handling:** Catch exceptions and return standardized error responses; never expose stack traces
- **Async/Await:** All I/O operations must use async
- **Logging:** Use structlog with JSON format; include context fields
- **API Versioning:** Not applicable (internal service, but follow FastAPI patterns)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Modules: `snake_case` (e.g., `mineru_parser.py`)
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `MinerUParser`)
- Functions: `snake_case`, async functions: `async def function_name()`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- API Routes: `kebab-case` (e.g., `/parse`)
- Pydantic Models: Suffix with type (e.g., `ParseRequest`, `ParseResponse`)

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Integration Tests (services/rag-anything/tests/):**
  - API endpoint tests using httpx AsyncClient
  - Test successful parsing for each supported format (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX, PPTX, CSV)
  - Test error handling for unsupported formats
  - Test error handling for corrupted files
  - Use pytest-asyncio for async test support
  - Fixtures for sample documents in `tests/fixtures/`

**Test File Organization:**
```
services/rag-anything/tests/
├── conftest.py                  # Pytest fixtures (test client, sample files)
├── test_parsers.py             # Parser unit tests
├── test_processors.py          # Processor unit tests
├── test_parse_endpoint.py      # Integration test for /parse endpoint
└── fixtures/
    ├── sample.pdf
    ├── sample.txt
    ├── sample.md
    ├── sample.docx
    ├── sample.pptx
    └── sample.csv
```

**Test Example:**
```python
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient
from fastapi import status

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_parse_pdf_success(
    async_client: AsyncClient,
    sample_pdf_file: bytes
):
    """Test successful PDF parsing."""
    files = {"file": ("test.pdf", sample_pdf_file, "application/pdf")}

    response = await async_client.post("/parse", files=files)

    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
    result = response.json()
    assert "content_list" in result
    assert len(result["content_list"]) > 0
    assert result["metadata"]["format"] == "pdf"
```

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.6.deployment-docs.md - Dev Agent Record]

**Relevant Learnings from Story 1.6:**
- Docker service health checks are critical for validation
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Platform-specific documentation is essential
- Integration tests should verify end-to-end functionality
- Use structured logging for monitoring and debugging

**Technical Patterns to Follow:**
- Use Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Include health check endpoints for all services
- Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Document optional features separately (e.g., GPU acceleration)

### Story 0.1 Spike Insights
[Reference: docs/stories/0.1.rag-anything-spike.md]

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Story 0.1 RAG-Anything Technical Validation Spike should be completed before this story
- Spike report will identify which parsers work and which need fallbacks
- AC10 fallback parsers depend on spike validation results

**Recommended Approach:**
- Review spike report findings before implementing parsers
- Prioritize formats that passed spike validation
- Implement fallback parsers for formats that failed
