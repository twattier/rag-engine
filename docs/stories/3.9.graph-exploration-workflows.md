# Story 3.9: Document Graph Exploration Workflows

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Graph-Based Retrieval, Knowledge Graph Construction & Visualization
**Story ID:** 3.9
**Status:** Draft
**Estimated Effort:** 1 story point (2-3 hours)

---

## User Story

**As a** knowledge base user,
**I want** clear guidance on exploring the knowledge graph visually,
**so that** I understand how documents are connected and validate retrieval quality.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/graph-exploration-workflows.md` provides step-by-step workflows for:
   - Finding a specific document in the graph
   - Exploring entities extracted from a document
   - Tracing relationships between entities across documents
   - Filtering graph view by metadata fields
   - Filtering graph view by entity types
   - Understanding retrieval paths (why a document was retrieved for a query)
2. Workflow documentation includes screenshots from LightRAG Server UI
3. Each workflow includes: goal, steps, expected outcome, common issues
4. Video tutorial (screencast) demonstrating graph exploration workflows (optional, time permitting)
5. Examples use real sample documents from integration tests
6. Documentation cross-references API endpoints for programmatic graph queries
