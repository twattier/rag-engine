## User Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** direct access to Neo4j Browser for database inspection,
**so that** I can debug graph structure and run custom Cypher queries.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Neo4j Browser accessible at `http://localhost:7474` (configured in Epic 1.2)
2. Documentation in `docs/neo4j-browser-guide.md` covering:
   - Accessing Neo4j Browser and authentication
   - Common Cypher queries for inspecting documents, entities, relationships
   - Example queries: "Show all entities of type X", "Find relationships between entities", "Count documents by metadata field"
3. Example Cypher query collection in `docs/example-queries.cypher`
4. Screenshots showing graph schema visualization in Neo4j Browser
5. Troubleshooting section for authentication issues and connection failures
6. Query performance tips: using indexes, limiting result sizes
