# Epic 5: Open-WebUI Integration & Production Readiness

**Epic Goal:** Create Open-WebUI Function Pipeline for seamless integration, implement production-grade error handling, logging, and deployment documentation for end-to-end MVP validation. Delivers primary user integration and production deployment readiness.

## Story 5.1: Develop Open-WebUI Function Pipeline

**As a** Open-WebUI user,
**I want** to deploy RAG Engine as a function pipeline in Open-WebUI,
**so that** I can query my knowledge base through Open-WebUI's chat interface.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Python function file `integrations/open-webui/rag_engine_pipeline.py` implements Open-WebUI Function interface
2. Function provides: document ingestion (via file upload in chat), knowledge base query (via chat messages), metadata filtering (via function parameters)
3. Function configuration includes: RAG Engine API endpoint, API key, retrieval mode selection, reranking toggle
4. Function returns formatted responses: cited sources with document names, relevance scores, metadata tags
5. Error handling: graceful degradation if RAG Engine unavailable, user-friendly error messages in chat
6. Installation instructions in `integrations/open-webui/README.md`:
   - Deploy RAG Engine via Docker Compose
   - Copy function file to Open-WebUI functions directory
   - Configure API endpoint and key in function settings
7. Screenshots showing Open-WebUI integration in action
8. Manual test verifies end-to-end workflow: upload document in Open-WebUI → query → receive cited results

## Story 5.2: Implement Production-Grade Error Handling and Retry Logic

**As a** platform operator,
**I want** automatic retry logic and graceful error recovery,
**so that** transient failures don't break user workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All external service calls (Neo4j, LightRAG, RAG-Anything, LLM) wrapped with retry logic:
   - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays
   - Max 3 retry attempts
   - Retry only on transient errors (connection timeout, 503 service unavailable)
2. Circuit breaker pattern for LLM calls: after 5 consecutive failures, stop calling LLM for 60 seconds (fail fast)
3. Graceful degradation: if reranking service fails, return non-reranked results with warning
4. Error logging includes: error type, retry attempts, service name, request context
5. Health check detects degraded service states and reports in `/health` endpoint
6. Configuration in `.env`: `RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`, `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TIMEOUT`
7. Integration tests simulate service failures and verify retry/fallback behavior

## Story 5.3: Implement Monitoring Endpoints and Operational Metrics

**As a** platform operator,
**I want** monitoring endpoints exposing operational metrics,
**so that** I can track system health and performance.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Metrics endpoint `GET /api/v1/metrics` returns JSON with:
   - Request counts by endpoint (last hour, last day)
   - Average response times per endpoint
   - Error rates by error type
   - Knowledge base statistics (documents, entities, relationships)
   - Neo4j database size and query performance metrics
2. Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint `GET /metrics` (using `prometheus-client` library) for future integration
3. Metrics include labels: endpoint, status_code, error_type
4. Performance counters: total_queries, successful_retrievals, failed_retrievals, avg_retrieval_latency_ms
5. System resource metrics: memory usage, CPU usage (via psutil)
6. Documentation in `docs/monitoring.md` explains metrics and alerting recommendations
7. Metrics endpoint requires authentication (same API key mechanism)

## Story 5.4: Create Production Deployment Documentation

**As a** production operator,
**I want** comprehensive deployment documentation for production environments,
**so that** I can deploy RAG Engine securely and reliably.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/production-deployment.md` covers:
   - Hardware requirements (CPU, RAM, storage) for different knowledge base sizes
   - Security hardening: API key rotation, TLS setup with reverse proxy (nginx example), network isolation
   - Backup and disaster recovery: Neo4j backup procedures, automated backup scripts
   - Scaling recommendations: when to upgrade hardware, multi-node deployment considerations (preview for Phase 2)
2. Example production `docker-compose.prod.yml` with:
   - Resource limits (memory, CPU) for each service
   - Health check configurations
   - Restart policies (always restart on failure)
   - Volume mount configurations for persistent storage
3. `scripts/backup-neo4j.sh` and `scripts/restore-neo4j.sh` for database backup/restore
4. Environment variable security: document using Docker secrets or external secret managers
5. Monitoring integration guidance: connecting Prometheus, log aggregation (ELK stack preview)
6. Troubleshooting section for production issues: OOM errors, disk space, network latency
7. Production checklist: security, backups, monitoring, documentation review

## Story 5.5: Conduct End-to-End MVP Validation and Performance Testing

**As a** product manager,
**I want** validation that all MVP success criteria are met,
**so that** I can confidently launch RAG Engine to users.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. End-to-end validation script `scripts/mvp-validation.sh` tests complete user journey:
   - Deploy RAG Engine with `docker-compose up`
   - Ingest 100+ documents across multiple formats with custom metadata
   - Define custom entity types
   - Query knowledge base with metadata filtering
   - Verify retrieval results include relevant documents
   - Access graph visualization UI and explore knowledge graph
   - Measure query latency (P95 < 2s target)
2. Performance benchmark script `scripts/benchmark-retrieval.sh`:
   - Test query performance on 1000-document knowledge base
   - Measure latency with/without metadata filtering
   - Compare retrieval modes (naive, local, global, hybrid)
   - Validate 50%+ latency reduction with metadata filtering on 20% subset
   - Test retrieval quality using BEIR SciFact dataset (MRR > 0.80 target)
3. Benchmark results documented in `docs/performance-benchmarks.md`
4. MVP success criteria validation report:
   - ✅ Single-command deployment completes in <5 minutes
   - ✅ End-to-end workflow (ingest, query, visualize) completes in <30 minutes
   - ✅ P95 query latency <2s on 1k document knowledge base
   - ✅ Retrieval quality improvement measured (comparison with baseline vector search, MRR > 0.80)
   - ✅ Open-WebUI integration functional
   - ✅ All documentation complete and tested
5. Known issues and limitations documented in `docs/known-issues.md`
6. Launch readiness checklist completed

## Story 5.6: Create User Onboarding Documentation and Quick Start Guide

**As a** new RAG Engine user,
**I want** a comprehensive quick start guide,
**so that** I can successfully deploy and use RAG Engine without prior knowledge.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/quick-start-guide.md` provides:
   - 5-minute overview of RAG Engine capabilities
   - Prerequisites checklist (Docker, hardware, ports)
   - Step-by-step deployment instructions with screenshots
   - First-time usage tutorial: ingest sample documents, run example queries
   - Common customization: changing metadata schema, adding entity types
2. Sample dataset provided in `examples/sample-documents/`:
   - 10-20 documents across different formats (PDF, Markdown, code)
   - Sample metadata CSV for batch ingestion
   - Example query prompts with expected results
3. Video tutorial (screencast, 10-15 minutes) demonstrating:
   - Deployment process
   - Document ingestion via API
   - Querying via Open-WebUI
   - Graph visualization exploration
4. FAQ section in `docs/faq.md` addressing:
   - Choosing LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama, local models)
   - Metadata schema design best practices
   - When to use different retrieval modes
   - Troubleshooting common errors
5. Community resources: link to Discord, GitHub Discussions, contribution guidelines
6. Feedback mechanism: issue templates for bugs, feature requests, documentation improvements
