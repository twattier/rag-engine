# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

**RAG Engine is a pure integration platform with zero custom UI development.** All user-facing interfaces are provided by the underlying services that RAG Engine orchestrates (LightRAG Server, Neo4j Browser, auto-generated API documentation). The product's UX strategy is "expose, don't create"—make the existing service UIs accessible through Docker networking and provide clear documentation for accessing them. Users experience RAG Engine primarily through programmatic integration (REST API, Open-WebUI Function Pipeline) with service-provided UIs serving operational/debugging purposes.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Service-Native Interfaces**: Users access LightRAG Server's built-in web UI (graph visualization, document indexing, query interface) directly at its exposed port—RAG Engine simply ensures it's running and accessible
- **API-First Integration**: Primary interaction is through REST API consumed by external tools (Open-WebUI, n8n, custom scripts)—no custom RAG Engine web application
- **Configuration-as-Code**: System configuration through `.env` files, Docker Compose parameters, and YAML schemas—no GUI configuration panels to develop
- **Operational Transparency via Existing Tools**: Use LightRAG Server's UI for graph exploration, Neo4j Browser for database inspection, Docker logs for debugging—all provided by upstream services

## Core Screens and Views

**RAG Engine provides NO custom screens/views. Users access:**

- **LightRAG Server Web UI** (provided by LightRAG Server): Graph visualization, document upload interface, query testing interface—exposed on configured port (default: localhost:9621)
- **Neo4j Browser** (provided by Neo4j): Database exploration, Cypher query interface, graph schema inspection—exposed on Neo4j port (default: localhost:7474)
- **Swagger/ReDoc API Docs** (auto-generated by FastAPI): Interactive API documentation for RAG Engine's REST endpoints—exposed on API service port
- **Open-WebUI Chat Interface** (provided by Open-WebUI): Users interact with RAG Engine through Open-WebUI's existing chat UI after deploying the Function Pipeline

**RAG Engine Scope:**
- Configure and expose these services via Docker Compose
- Provide clear documentation on accessing each service UI (URLs, ports, default credentials)
- Ensure services are network-accessible within Docker environment

## Accessibility

**Not Applicable to RAG Engine MVP**

Accessibility is determined by the upstream services (LightRAG Server, Neo4j Browser, OpenAPI generators). RAG Engine does not develop custom UI components and therefore does not control accessibility implementation.

**Documentation Responsibility**: Provide links to each service's accessibility documentation where available.

## Branding

**No Custom Branding or Theming**

RAG Engine does not implement custom visual identity. Users see:
- LightRAG Server's default UI styling
- Neo4j Browser's default styling
- FastAPI's default Swagger/ReDoc themes

**RAG Engine Branding Limited To:**
- README.md header/logo (documentation only)
- API response headers (e.g., `X-Powered-By: RAG-Engine/1.0`)
- Docker Compose project name

## Target Device and Platforms

**Inherited from Service UIs**

- **LightRAG Server**: Desktop web browsers (as designed by LightRAG Server team)
- **Neo4j Browser**: Desktop web browsers (as designed by Neo4j)
- **API Documentation**: Any device capable of viewing web pages
- **REST API Access**: Platform-agnostic (any HTTP client on any platform)

**RAG Engine's Platform Responsibility**: Ensure Docker deployment works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with WSL2
