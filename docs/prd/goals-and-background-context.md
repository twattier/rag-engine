# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a production-ready RAG deployment platform that achieves "ultimate" retrieval quality through graph-based knowledge representation
- Enable single-command Docker deployment (`docker-compose up -d`) that runs sophisticated RAG infrastructure without DevOps expertise
- Provide multi-format document ingestion (PDF, Markdown, HTML, Word, code) with intelligent graph entity extraction
- Support multiple integration patterns (Open-WebUI, MCP, n8n, Pydantic SDK, REST API) from a unified knowledge base
- Achieve 85%+ retrieval relevance vs. 60-70% baseline through hybrid retrieval, graph traversal, and reranking
- Empower users with graph visualization UI for knowledge exploration and retrieval validation
- Enable custom metadata fields and domain-specific entity types to improve graph quality and search precision
- Demonstrate deployment time-to-value under 30 minutes from setup to first successful query

## Background Context

Organizations and developers building AI applications face a critical dilemma: basic RAG implementations are easy to deploy but deliver poor retrieval quality, while sophisticated graph-based solutions like LightRAG offer superior results but require extensive infrastructure expertise. This gap forces teams to choose between quick deployment and performance, wasting developer time on infrastructure rather than improving retrieval quality.

RAG Engine solves this by integrating best-in-class open-source RAG technologies (LightRAG for graph-based retrieval, RAG-Anything for multi-format ingestion) into a production-grade Docker-based deployment platform. By standing on the shoulders of giants rather than reinventing algorithms, we deliver ultimate RAG performance with operational excellenceâ€”all running locally with zero vendor lock-in.
