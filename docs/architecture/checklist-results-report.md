# Checklist Results Report

This architecture document is now complete. Before finalizing, the following architect checklist should be executed:

**Pre-Checklist Actions:**
1. ✅ Architecture document created with all sections populated
2. ✅ Tech stack finalized based on PRD requirements and LightRAG/RAG-Anything constraints
3. ✅ API specification defined with OpenAPI 3.0 schema
4. ✅ Data models designed with TypeScript interfaces and Neo4j schema
5. ✅ Component architecture detailed with service responsibilities
6. ✅ Docker Compose deployment strategy documented
7. ✅ Testing strategy defined with examples
8. ✅ Security and performance considerations addressed

**Next Steps:**
- Review this document with the user for feedback
- Execute `*execute-checklist architect-checklist` to validate architecture completeness
- Address any gaps or questions identified in checklist
- Output final architecture document to [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)
- Begin implementation phase with AI development agents using this architecture as reference

**User Confirmation Required:**
- Does this architecture align with your vision for RAG Engine?
- Are there any critical components or considerations missing?
- Should any technology choices be reconsidered before implementation begins?
- Do the network port configuration guidelines (`.env` based, user-configurable) address your concerns?

Once confirmed, this architecture document will serve as the **single source of truth** for all development work on RAG Engine.
