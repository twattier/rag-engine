SCANNED PDF REQUIREMENT:

A scanned/image-based PDF is needed for OCR testing.
Since we cannot easily generate this programmatically,
options:
1. Print one of the generated PDFs and scan it
2. Convert a page to image and embed in PDF
3. Download a sample scanned document
4. Use tesseract to generate one from an image

For spike purposes, we can test OCR capabilities on
a converted image-based PDF or skip this specific test
and note it in the spike report.
